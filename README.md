# Space Shooter in Python

This is my first ever game in Python. It was made following the tuotiral of [Cear Code](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode).

Link of the video right here :arrow_right: *<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMghdHP-zs>*  
The goal was to familiarized myself with python coming, mostly, from a javascript and typescript background.

It is a basic space shooter where the player controls a spaceship with arrow keys and shoots meteors.

Enjoy ! :grin:
