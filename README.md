# Space Shooter in Python 

This is my first ever game made in Python. I followed the youtube tutorial of [@CearCode](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode).  
Link to the video :arrow_right: *<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMghdHP-zs>*

The goal was to familiarized myself with python since I was, mostly, from a javascript and typescript background.

It is a basic space shooter where the player controls a spaceship with arrow-keys and shoots meteors.

Enjoy ! :grin:
